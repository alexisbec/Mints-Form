# Mints-Form

This project consists of building an HTML document that matches the appearance of mint.com‚Äôs signup page.

## Description of the Project

We design a sign up page from scratch, making it look identical to a pre-existing page without copying its code. For that we've used semantic elements on the structure, and the flex attribute on the position styling, submit forms that accept different types of values such as numbers for phone numbers, encrypted values to hide passwords, and so on. Aside from that was pretty much alike our previous project where we make an identical replica of an old youtube page.

## Built With

HTML & CSS
