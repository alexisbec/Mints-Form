# Mints-Form

This project consists of building an HTML document that matches the appearance of mint.com‚Äôs signup page.

## Description of the Project

We design the Youtube page from scratch, making it look identical to the original without copying any of the code from it. For that we've used HTML and CSS languages, the former to layout the structure, distribution, size and shape of several sections of the page, and the other to give to them the colors, fonts and overall style that characterizes the platform. For better precision at these tasks and the readability of the code, we've implemented proper semantic elements, used attributes such as flex for positioning, reset the default values of elements such as body, applied values in general with the universal selector, used features like inheritance, specificity, and so forth. We've also went back and forth using the collaborative pair programming method analog to the pilot co-pilot duo, and added a property right's license to it.
